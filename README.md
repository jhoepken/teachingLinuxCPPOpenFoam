## Teaching CPP

This repository contains the contents and materials I use for teaching C++ and
OpenFOAM at UDE. The entire class targets our mechanical engineering/naval
architecture students that need to learn how to deal with Linux, a shell, C++
and OpenFOAM. To cover each of these topics, it is impossible to go into any
details of more advanced topics. Though the class is usually held in German, I
composed the materials in English, so that others might benefit from them as
well. The writing in the following is kept as short as possible, as their main
purpose is to serve me during the classes not to forget anything.
