4. Create the mandatory body of a C++ program
4. Save the file
5. Compile
6. Execute

## Part 2

Fill the program with life

1. Include library that takes care of printing things to the screen
2. Print "hello world" to the screen and end the line *properly*
3. Save the file
4. Compile
5. Execute

## Part 3

Simplify the program code by importing everything of the ``std`` namespace
