# C++ - The very basics

## Part 1

Write a C++ program that prints ``hello world`` to the screen

1. Generate a directory called ``lesson_02`` and change into it
2. Generate an empty file called ``helloWorld.C``
3. Open ``helloWorld.C`` in the texteditor of your choice
4. Create the mandatory body of a C++ program
4. Save the file
5. Compile
6. Execute

## Part 2

Fill the program with life

1. Include library that takes care of printing things to the screen
2. Print "hello world" to the screen and end the line *properly*
3. Save the file
4. Compile
5. Execute

## Part 3

Simplify the program code by importing everything of the ``std`` namespace

1. Change ``helloWorld.C`` accordingly
2. Save the file
3. Compile
4. Execute

# C++ - Add all natural numbers $\left[1;1000\right]$

## Some of the steps

1. Copy ``helloWorld.C`` to ``add.C``
2. Edit the new file
3. Implement the algorithm that takes care of the addition
4. Print the result to screen
4. Save, Compile and Execute
